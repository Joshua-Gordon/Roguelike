# Roguelike
This is a roguelike game I'm making because...
uh...
ok, you got me, I really don't have a good reason. I also started when I should have been studying for finals, so that might have also played a role in it.

## Anyway
The game is going to take place in a futuristic setting where everyone is a robot. You have to rescue a mecha dragon from an evil princess.
